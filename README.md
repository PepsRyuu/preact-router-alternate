# Preact Router Alternate

Alternative router for Preact apps. 
Uses a similar API to React Router, but with some minor changes which I think make more sense.

## Getting Started

```npm install preact-router-alternate```

## Features

* HTML5 History only.
* Nested routes.
* Router, Switch, Route, Redirect, Link, Prompt components which are very similar to React Router.
* Prompt allows you by default to provide a custom component instead of showing alert box.
* TransitionSwitch component for animating between routes.

## Examples

Example app in the ```examples``` directory demonstrates different things you can do with this library.

To run the examples:

```
cd examples
npm install
npm start
```

Then go to ```http://localhost:9001``` in your browser.
